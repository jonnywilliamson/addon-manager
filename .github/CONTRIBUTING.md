# Contributing

Contributions are **welcome** and will be fully **credited**.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on Github.

## Pull Requests

- **Coding Standard** - Please follow the **[PSR-12 Coding Standard](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/)**.

- **Add Tests** Ensure that the current tests pass, and if you've added something new, add the tests where relevant.

- **Document any change in behaviour** - Make sure the relevant documentation are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle** - We try to follow [SemVer v2.0.0](https://semver.org/). Randomly breaking public APIs is not an option.

- **Create feature branches** - Don't ask us to pull from your master branch.

- **One pull request per feature** - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Send coherent history** - Make sure each individual commit in your pull request is meaningful. If you had to make multiple intermediate commits while developing, please [squash them](https://www.git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Tools-Rewriting-History#Changing-Multiple-Commit-Messages) before submitting.

- **Rebase** - You may also need to [rebase](https://git-scm.com/book/en/Git-Branching-Rebasing) to avoid merge conflicts.

## Running Tests

``` bash
$ composer test
```

**Happy coding**!
